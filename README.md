# My First ML Project

This is a simple Machine Learning project that predicts the species of the Iris flower based on its features using Python.

## 🧠 Project Description

This project uses the famous **Iris dataset** (sepal & petal measurements) to train a machine learning model that can classify three types of Iris flowers:
- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica

The model learns from the dataset and predicts the species given new measurements.
