# 🌱 My First Machine Learning Project

This is a simple Machine Learning project that predicts the species of the Iris flower based on its features using Python.

The beginner-friendly machine learning project that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple classifier using the classic **Iris dataset**. It’s a great starting point if you’re learning supervised learning, classification models, and Python ML tooling.

## 🔎 Project Description

This project uses the famous **Iris dataset** (sepal & petal measurements) to train a machine learning model that can classify three types of Iris flowers:
- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica

The model learns from the dataset and predicts the species given new measurements.

The goal of this project is to:
- Load the Iris dataset
- Explore and visualize the data
- Train a machine learning model
- Predict the species of an iris flower given its features

- **Python**  
- **scikit-learn** — for model building  
- **NumPy & pandas** — for data handling
